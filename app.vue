Here, we're going to need to do a few things.

First, check if cookies are stored.

If so, we need to write a 'getUserRole()' function that get's
user's set type from Db, then will render pages based on role.

else, show schedule/map component

Ie.
"'user logged in as 'Merchant'" --> Landing page at '/' will render different view component than if role == 'Vendor'
If so, get user role.
